s_start_screen + 0x4 == main_title_timer

it'll count the timer for:
	1. Display "Press Start"
	2. If it goes to 0 (or reach? dunno lmao) and no one pressed any button
	it'll go to Capcom Logo


start screen has two state machine:


1. deal with fade out (maybe when the player won't press anything and go back
to capcom logo)
2. sub "state" that is the main title screen

0x0200B1A0 - g_main_title_screen_state

A EWRAM variable (global) used to determine the main title screen state

Value table:

0x00 - We are in CAPCOM logo
0x01 - We are in main title screen logo but without show the "PRESS START"
0x02 - We are in main title screen logo but with "PRESS START"

It seems to be used to control when the player can press any button and start
the game


This work together with 0x0200B1A3

0x0200B1A3 - g_main_title_screen_timer

The timer is used to know what is the next state for the main title screen



nomeclature:

main title = title screen
