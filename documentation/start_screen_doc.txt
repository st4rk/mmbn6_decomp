s_start_screen + 0x4 == main_title_timer

it'll count the timer for:
	1. Display "Press Start"
	2. If it goes to 0 (or reach? dunno lmao) and no one pressed any button
	it'll go to Capcom Logo


start screen has two state machine:


1. deal with fade out (maybe when the player won't press anything and go back
to capcom logo)
2. sub "state" that is the main title screen
